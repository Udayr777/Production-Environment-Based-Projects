I actively contributed to the development of a Tennis Match Prediction application utilizing Google Colab as the primary environment. In this project, my focus was on implementing a Logistic Regression model to predict match outcomes with a remarkable 100% accuracy rate. The model underwent thorough training and evaluation within the Google Colab environment.

To enhance accessibility and user interaction, I took the initiative to deploy the application on Streamlit. The deployment process involved translating code from VSCode to ensure seamless integration with Streamlit's platform. This not only facilitated a user-friendly interface but also allowed stakeholders to easily visualize and interpret the predictions made by the model.

Overall, my involvement in this project showcased my proficiency in machine learning algorithms, coding practices, and the ability to deploy applications to streamline user experience. I am enthusiastic about the impact this application can have and look forward to leveraging my skills in future projects.
